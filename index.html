<a href=https://youtu.be/2s5xdY6MCeI>one of my favorites from the album</a>

<p> I was never a Taylor Swift fan. However, my best friends are.</p>

<p>So, of course, I fell into the trap. At first, I was forced to listen to her music,</p>

<p>but soon enough, I found that the same songs I was complaining about</p>

<p> were the same songs making it into my morning playlists. Then soon my</p>

<p>afternoon playlists, then the nighttime ones, and so on. I realized that the</p>

<p>music was speaking to me, not just entertaining me. I realized that, </p>

<p>particularly Taylor Swift's Folklore album, was what had me dropping my</p>

<p>jaw. Maybe it was the way she could say how I was feeling better than I</p>

<p>couldâ€¦ Well, whatever it is, I now know that I stand by the people who say</p>

<p>that Taylor Swift is a lyrical genius.</p>
